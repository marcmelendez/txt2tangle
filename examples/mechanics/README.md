# Hamiltonian mechanics in maxima


This program tries to derive the Euler-Lagrange and Hamilton's canonical
equations of motion for a system described by a set of generalised coordinates
and a potential energy function. The explanation below assumes at least some
familiarity with Hamiltonian mechanics.

The maxima code written here illustrates literate programming with txt2tangle.
