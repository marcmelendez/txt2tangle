# Escape rate for a Brownian particle in a radial cubic spline trap

Brownian motion has many applications in mathematics, physics and finance, but
it was originally conceived as the description of small micron-scale particles
suspended in water, which vibrate due to thermal fluctuations. Here, we are
interested in a Brownian particle that moves around in two dimensions and feels
the force due to a particular type of potential energy trap. We aim to describe
the time it takes for such a particle to escape from the trap.

## Aim

This short project illustrates literate programming using the **txt2tangle**
tool. You can check out the final result in the **kramers.pdf** file.

## Compiling and running

This project assumes that your system has the following tools installed:
**txt2tangle**, **make**, **gcc**, **bash**, **gnuplot**, **latex**, **dvips**
and **ps2pdf**. *All* the files for this project (including this one) stem from
**kramers.tex**. By running `txt2tangle kramers.tex`, you can generate the
`Makefile`. Everything else in the project (compiling, running and outputting
the final report) takes place when you execute `make`.
