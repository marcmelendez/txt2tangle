*   txt2tangle: A very simple literate programming tool   *
***********************************************************

Charmed with Donald Knuth's concept of programming with
human readers in mind, but being too lazy to install and
learn how to use a proper tool such as CWEB, I decided to
work on a one-day DIY tool which enabled me to extract code
snippets from a plain text document and put them together
in the right order. I wanted to make something very simple
but useful to me, so I came up with a system that would
allow me to extract code from plain ascii text files, but
also other source code files, such as LaTeX, txt2tags or C.

To understand the basic idea, consider the following code
snippet with the beginning of the README file for this
project, which goes from the "%! codefile" statement to
the "%! codepause" statement.

%! codefile: README.md
# txt2tangle: A very simple literate programming tool

I create readable code with **txt2tangle**. Instead of
writing for a computer, I write for humans. Beginning with
an explanation in a plain text file (or perhaps a source
code file, such as a LaTeX document), I simply insert
**txt2tangle** commands on their own line, preceded by a
special string ("%!" by default, but that may be changed as
seen [below](#command-line-options)) and use them to mark
which parts of the text are intended as code.

For example, a document for a typical *Hello world* program
might look like this:

> `=== Hello, World! ===`
>
> `A "Hello, World!" example program.`
>
> `%! codefile: helloworld.bc`
> `print "Hello, world!\n";`
> `quit();`
> `%! codeend`

From this text file, **txt2tangle** would create the
`helloworld.bc` file.

As a matter of fact, *all* the files for this project were
created by **txt2tangle** from just two plain text files:
`txt2tangle.txt`, which contains the information to
generate this README file, among others, and
`txt2tangle.txt`, which contains the C code to make the
**txt2tangle** executable file.

%! codepause
...........................................................

As you can see, we begin writing code into a file with the
"%! codefile:" instruction. The end of the file is marked
with "%! codeend", but we might wish to pause writing to a
file (as above) with "%! codepause". That means that *this*
paragraph will not end up in the README file. To resume
output to the code file, use "%! codecontinue:", followed
by the file name.

You may open several files in your source document, and you
need not insert a "%! codeend" to reach the end of one file
before starting the output into the next one.

To illustrate this, let us create the project Makefile now,
even though we have not finished writing to README.md.

...........................................................
%! codefile: Makefile
all:
	./txt2tangle txt2tangledoc.txt
	gcc -Wall -O2 -o txt2tangle txt2tangle.c

first:
	gcc -Wall -O2 -o txt2tangle txt2tangle.c
	./txt2tangle txt2tangledoc.txt
%! codeend
...........................................................

Although we may have written to several files, we had to do
so sequentially. However, we might wish to leave a section
of code for an appendix at the end, or explain a section of
code that will be used later on. With this in mind, I
defined code blocks. Here is an example of a code block:

...........................................................
%! codeblock: howto

## How to use **txt2tangle**

For a simple tutorial explaining how to write code with
**txt2tangle**, refer to the `txt2tangledoc.txt` text file
that generated the code for this `README.md`. To see how
**txt2tangle** works, you can either read the C code
directly (`txt2tangle.c`) or read the more literate
`txt2tangle.txt`file that generated it.

%! codeblockend
...........................................................

The code above will be inserted into the output file with
an "%! insertcode" command, later on, when I list all the
txt2tangle statements in the README file. You can also
bring in code from another source file by adding the
filename to the code insertion command, writing something
like "%! insertcode: myBlock src: myOtherFile". Code blocks
may include "%! insertcode" statements.

Thus concludes our tour of txt2tangle. That is all there is
to the program. A quick-reference list of the commands
follows.

...........................................................
%! codecontinue: README.md

## **txt2tangle** commands

* `%! codefile: <filename>` opens a source code file for
output.
* `%! codeend` marks the end of the source code file.
* `%! codepause` stops sending output to the code file.
* `%! codecontinue: <filename>` resumes output to the file
specified.
* `%! codeblock: <blockname>` specifies a block of code.
* `%! codeinsert: <blockname>` or
`%! codeinsert: <blockname> src: <filename>` inserts the
specified block from the source file mentioned. If no
source file was named, the current file being read is
assumed.

%! insertcode: howto

## Command-line options

The only command-line option is `-c`, which allows you to
change the default string marking the beginning of a
**txt2tangle** command. You could write, for example
``txt2tangle -c // example.txt``
and the program would identify strings such as
``// codefile: out.c``
and
``// codeend``, for example.

%! codeend
